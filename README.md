project-review
==============

This repository supports the project review process for the AmI-2014 course, taught at Politecnico di Torino.

Groups participating to the course may book project consultancy by opening an issue on this repository, reporting the group name, and a brief description of required consultancy. Issues for booking project consultancies should be tagged using the *consultancy* and *book* tags

Project review results might also be uploaded as files on the repository and will be accessible to every group.
