Project review
==============

This repository supports the project review process for the AmI-2014 course, taught at Politecnico di Torino.

Groups participating to the course may book project consultancy (to be held on May, 15th) by opening an issue on this repository, reporting the group name and a brief description of required consultancy. Issues for booking project consultancies should be tagged using the *help wanted* label.

Project review results might also be uploaded as files on the repository and will be accessible to every group.
